# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

The hardest part for me was finding out where the pind and sind goes, and even now I'm still confused on the preferred layout/method, I think that's why I kept ending up in infinite loops that I couldnt seem to get out of.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.


I could use the match function to check if the user input matches what is in the database, and if not we can print something such as "Movie not found." We can also use the match function in partner with different functions to try and change the movie list and try to get a grasp on how the pattern works. I think this would give us a stronger grip on how databases work. ( I'm not sure how to do it in python, but I did something similar in java last year.)
